MDSC-Encoder: A Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Autoencoder for Predicting M-MDSC Cell Proportions Using DNA Methylation Biomarkers
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immune cells that play a critical role in surgical recovery, cancer progression, and immune regulation (1-3). These cells are broadly classified into two subsets including granulocytic (G-MDSCs) and monocytic (M-MDSCs) (4). Both subsets have been associated with postoperative complications, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction (5-7). Flow cytometry is currently considered the gold standard for quantifying MDSC subsets. However, this method presents significant difficulties in the measurement process including high costs, reliance on fresh samples, and technical variability due to sample handling and instrumentation differences. These challenges highlight the urgent need for alternative approaches to estimating G-MDSC and M-MDSC proportions in clinical and research settings.

DNA methylation profiling has emerged as a powerful tool for deconvolving immune cells by utilizing cell-type-specific epigenetic patterns to infer leukocyte composition from peripheral blood (8). Several computational methods have been developed to estimate the proportions of immune cells using DNA methylation data primarily obtained from Illumina Infinium arrays (e.g., EPIC and 450K)(8-11).  Houseman’s methods (Houseman et al., 2012) allow for the estimation of major immune subsets including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and granulocytes utilizing reference DNA methylation libraries(9). However, while these methods successfully predict broad immune populations, they do not yet distinguish specialized subsets such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which possess unique immunosuppressive properties in cancer and post-surgical contexts.

Developing a method to estimate MDSC levels using DNA methylation would be highly valuable for studying immune responses in various clinical situations, such as nutritional interventions, surgery, infections, chronic inflammation, and cancer. DNA methylation-based markers for MDSCs would help researchers validate these results across diverse patient populations, potentially enhancing personalized treatment strategies and clinical decision-making. In this study, we aim to develop machine learning models—including elastic net regression and deep learning frameworks—to predict G-MDSC and M-MDSC proportions using CpG-specific DNA methylation data. These models will be trained on flow cytometry-derived MDSC proportions that serve as the ground truth. By establishing a robust epigenetic biomarker for these immune cell populations, our work addresses the current limitations of flow cytometry and provides a broad approach to immune profiling.
